Object Detection Utilizing a Deep Learning Model (YOLOv5)

YOLOv5 is an open source model from the YOLO family that was developed using the PyTorch deep learning framework. It is a state of the art object detection model featuring advanced image detectors that are capable of performing real-time object detection with high accuracy making YOLOv5 an effective tool in computer vision where it can identify objects in a single pass.  It works especially well for applications that require immediate feedback, such as surveillance systems and real-time monitoring.


I designed a community facing a flood implementing a UAV that can video the area and identify who and how many potential lives there are.
